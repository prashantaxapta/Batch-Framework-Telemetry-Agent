## 🧠 Overview

The Batch Telemetry Agent is an AI-powered monitoring and diagnostic solution designed to optimize batch job execution within Dynamics 365 SCM & Finance. It leverages telemetry streamed into Azure Application Insights and integrates with **Copilot Studio** to provide actionable insights, alerts, and automation capabilities.

## 🔧 Key Capabilities

- 📡 **Telemetry Collection**: Captures signals such as job start/end times, thread usage, throttling metrics, queue sizes, failures, and Infolog errors.
- 💬 **Prompt-Based Analysis**: Uses GPT-4o and GPT-5 models to interpret telemetry data via natural language prompts.
- 🚨 **Anomaly Detection**: Applies Kusto (KQL) queries and AI models to detect performance degradation and scheduling inefficiencies.
- 🛠️ **Self-Healing Options**: Supports guided or autonomous remediation actions like restarting failed jobs.
- 📊 **Visualization & Reporting**: Offers dashboards for workload distribution, priority spread, throttling trends, and batch exceptions.

## 🏗️ Architecture

</p>

- 🔄 **Telemetry Flow**: Batch Telemetry events from D365 F&O are streamed to Application Insights.
- 🧮 **Agent Logic**: Queries telemetry periodically or on-demand, evaluates rules, and stores results in Dataverse.
- 🧑‍💻 **User Interaction**: Users engage via Copilot chat, canvas apps, or Teams channels.
- ⚙️ **Remediation Execution**: Actions are triggered via MCP Server and verified through telemetry feedback loops.

## ✅ Prerequisites

- 📦 D365 F&O version 10.0.45 or later
- 🔍 Azure Application Insights configured for batch telemetry
- 🧠 Access to Copilot Studio and Power Automate
- 🧰 Optional: Microsoft Fabric for extended data handling

## 🛠️ Step 1 - Telemetry Configuration

Ensure batch telemetry is enabled in D365 F&O and connected to Application Insights.

## 🛠️ Step 2 - Agent Deployment

- Import the agent canvas app into Copilot Studio.
- Configure prompts and remediation rules.
- Set up Power Automate flows for notifications.

## 🛠️ Step 3 - Knowledge Source Integration

- Connect Microsoft Learn Docs MCP Server for contextual guidance.
- Optionally integrate Fabric for large-scale telemetry analysis.

## 🧪 Usage

### 💬 Prompt Examples

- "Show me batch jobs throttled in the last 7 days."
- "What are the top 3 batch jobs causing latency spikes?"
- "Suggest optimal scheduling time for job P-0001."

### ⚙️ Automation Scenarios

- Restart failed jobs based on error codes.
- Adjust job priorities based on historical performance.
- Notify admins via Teams when anomalies are detected.
